##Usage:
Enter the variable values, confirm the settings, and click OK. A script will be created at the destination location.  Once the script is generated, open a new board and run the script.  You can use the source board if you set the origin so it won't conflict with the original board.

##Variables:
    Origin - where to start the panel array.  Usually (0,0) or (0,0) plus the height of the current board.
    Columns - Number of boards to make in the X direction.
    Rows - Number of boards to make in the Y direction.
    X Spacing - Distance between boards in X direction.
    Y Spacing - Distance between boards in Y direction.
